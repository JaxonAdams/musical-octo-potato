## Description
This small MERN application is a personal project to set up an online planner for me and my wife. You can save events to the Mongo database, and edit or delete them when your plans change. On the front end, it uses React, React Router, and Axios for the main functionality. I also experimented with some interesting things such as custom modals for the forms, time format validation with regex, and a custom sort algorithm.
